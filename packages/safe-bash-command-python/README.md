# Python for Safe Bash

Run Python commands against your shell's virtual filesystem, with explicit runtime,
package, and host-service configuration through Safe Bash's public exports.

```ts
import { Shell } from "@poe-platform/safe-bash";
import { pythonExecutorCommands } from "@poe-platform/safe-bash/commands/python/executor";

const shell = new Shell({ fs });
shell.use(pythonExecutorCommands({ createExecutor }));
const result = await shell.exec('python3 -c "print(42)"');
```

Provide `fs` and a trusted `createExecutor` for your application. Executor, JSPI,
worker, and Docker profiles retain their own runtime prerequisites. Runtime assets
and package provisioning remain explicitly configured; JavaScript interoperability
does not isolate untrusted Python from its host.

- `python` and `python3`: inline code, stdin, modules, and VFS scripts.
- Executor pooling, cancellation, cleanup, and bounded filesystem replies.
- Package provisioning with cache and manifest support.
- Optional shell and LLM host capabilities.

Use `PythonCommandsOptions` to configure limits, runtime providers, and packages.
Existing default command behavior and registration collision rules are unchanged.
This package is internal and bundled into Safe Bash; consumers use the public
Safe Bash paths above, including `/commands/python/node`, `/worker`, and `/docker`.

Python LLM buffered calls and streams preserve the same host error classifications:
unsupported model capabilities and other service failures raise `poe_llm.LlmError`
with code `service` and a sanitized message. Host limits raise `LimitError` with
code `limit`; timeouts raise `asyncio.TimeoutError`. `CapabilityError` remains
available for explicit capability errors, such as an unavailable Python LLM bridge.

The genuine `llm==0.27.1` provider exposes tools when the host model declares
the `tools` capability. Pass native `llm.Tool` values to sync or async prompts;
returned calls support the reference's `execute_tool_calls()` callbacks and
results. The adapter forwards caller-supplied prior calls and tool results to
the same shared service. Large result text uses bounded writes to the caller's
filesystem and releases temporary inputs after each request. Tool schemas,
arguments and response metadata remain subject to host byte limits. Tool
implementations execute in the configured Python runtime; credentials and
provider transport remain host-owned.
