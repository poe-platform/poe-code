# safe-bash-mcp

Discover tool schemas for remote MCP servers using the repository's MCP client.
Supply known schemas to skip network discovery, or leave `tools` absent to fetch
every page automatically. Streamable HTTP and legacy HTTP/SSE endpoints are
handled by `tiny-mcp-client`. Discovery tries legacy SSE automatically only when
HTTP connection setup returns 404 or 405. Set `transport: "http"` or `"sse"`
to pin a transport. Local process servers are not supported.

```ts
import { resolveRemoteMcpSchemas } from "safe-bash-mcp";

const schemas = await resolveRemoteMcpSchemas([
  { name: "catalog", url: "https://catalog.example/mcp" },
  { name: "known", url: "https://known.example/mcp", tools: knownTools }
], { signal: controller.signal });
```

An explicitly empty `tools: []` is authoritative and never connects. Returned
schemas are independent copies and retain tool descriptions, annotations,
input/output schemas and other metadata. Discovered snapshots also include
server identity, capabilities and instructions.

| SDK function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `fetchRemoteMcpSchema(server, options)` | Resolve one server's tool schemas |
| `resolveRemoteMcpSchemas(servers, options)` | Preflight a registry and resolve it in order |

Use `headers` or the client's `oauth` options for credentials. URLs must use
HTTP or HTTPS without embedded credentials or fragments. Discovery supports
injected `fetch`, OAuth discovery caches, warning callbacks and cancellation.
Set `maxPages`, `maxTools`, `maxResponseBytes` and `requestTimeoutMs` to bound
discovery. Defaults are 100 pages, 10,000 tools, 16 MiB per HTTP response and
30 seconds per request. Cyclic cursors and duplicate tools fail explicitly;
connections close on success, failure and cancellation. Network, authentication,
rate-limit and server errors retain their original cause. If automatic SSE
fallback also fails, the error retains both failures.

Safe-bash command generation and the OAuth credential initialization command
are under development.
