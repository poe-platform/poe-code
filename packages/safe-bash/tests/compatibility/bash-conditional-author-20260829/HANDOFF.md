# Conditional author handoff — qualified RED, independent review required

2026-08-29. No native Bash, private engine, network, comparator or whole gate.
No further runtime replay is requested or performed by this handoff.

## Exact source and package

* Source chain: `9c830955fd891e9276dcb7414c39dcf6c051d570` initial grammar/evaluator;
  `cea06f4cd6afe9087958f94825274636fa221a57` two TypeScript corrections;
  `6fde455bcc103117a6424b95156b152721f5735f` empty-path predicate correction.
* Final derived tree `501ad98748e639c909f717007dac4f1da19c67dc` is reconstructed
  from the accepted public80 + Unit1 + resolved Unit2 manifest plus exactly four
  owned production blobs. Not raw HEAD or an assertion that the derived tree is
  stored. `SOURCE-v3.json` SHA256
  `74c94ab8fb9531f5a704e51d12b6ab713280541758f36cd03de51fe0d630d4da`,293 inputs.
* Final full package SHA256
  `4df8658746a881fd1316e403a234fd941baccfdead7a9518bc39fa7f6df2bb6e`,
  871054 bytes,954 members. Whole pack installed offline/scripts disabled and
  physically moved; all member hashes/modes and emitted/load bindings checked.
  `package.json`, root exports/default80 and dependencies are unchanged.
* Actual source commit is6fde455b, final preseal `c03b843b` (full commit resolvable
  from Git), controls/runner hashes in EXECUTOR-v3. No mutable source overlay.

## Author outcomes (do not promote to independent acceptance)

| Cohort | Source | Installed | Physically moved |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| New conditional,40 scripts+10 host protocols |49/50|49/50|49/50|
| Resolved Unit2 author |50/50|50/50|50/50|
| Unit1 versioned-v3 (one obsolete refusal changed) |48/48|48/48|48/48|
| Existing Git public / apply / arrays / coherence |45+28+12+18|45+28+12+18|45+28+12+18|

Thus main251 per layout gives **750 pass /3 fail of753**. Three restored-control
executions pass separately. Strict types6groups pass, including24 expected negative
diagnostics (8 per layout;2 specifically conditional AST). Three loaded mutants
are killed with original bytes restored: quote-literal loss, eager logical
evaluation, node-cap removal. Two package-binding refusals pass. Build passes.
No original design/native row is silently converted into a product golden.

## H02 remains failed, not waived

`conditional.mjs:61` supplies a custom stat method which aborts its caller and
then awaits setImmediate in finally before setting `closed=true`. It registers
no invocation cleanup and exposes no resource/cleanup handle in FsOptions.
All layouts receive the **exact caller reason**, but `closed` is still false at
public exec rejection. The failing assertion is that boolean, not reason identity.
Each Shell.dispose fulfills and each consumer process subsequently exits naturally.

Source-supported interpretation: this probes delayed finalization of an
**unenrolled host promise**. It does not prove an OS resource leak, does not
establish that a registered cleanup failed, and also does not prove finalization
was complete at public settlement. The current fixture has no explicit post-finally
counter observation; natural child retirement is a different observation.

Root/different reviewer must decide the supported ownership expectation before
changing this fixture or production. Blindly registering/draining arbitrary FS
promises could impose opaque-host blocking not authorized by the cooperative
cleanup contract. No such workaround, timeout increase, new shared API or fixture
normalization was made. H02 remains exactly failed3 times. This is not a green
conditional gate or an all-cleanup claim.

The existing runner classified H02 as an ordinary assertion (Shell disposal and
child retirement flags remained clean) and continued safely to capture other
rows; it did not mark the provider-finalizer assertion as passing.

## Preserved prior failures and fixture delta

V1: two TS2345 build errors, no product cases; both children retired. V2: actual
build/full pack passed, but the author mistakenly imported nonexistent
`virtual-bash/shell`; package exports correctly refused it. The correct public
root already exports parseShell. V2 Unit1 C02 was47/48 because it still expected
`[[ x ]]` rejection. All captures and v1/v2 manifests remain immutable.

New own-scope `redirections-v3.mjs` preserves all four C02 input scripts: only
`[[ x ]]` now requires status0/empty stderr; background &, &>>, dynamic exec-fd
remain rejected. All other48-cohort cases/assertions unchanged; old fixture stays
untouched. Conditional A22 additionally checks an empty metadata path is false,
not cwd. These are explicit versioned changes, not a rescore of earlier outputs.

## Budgets, retirement and provenance

Preparation began05:23:17Z; actual grant05:33:57Z, final runtime ended05:41:29Z,
artifact publication05:43:22Z, without resetting the master wall origin.
Final run39 direct children +29 internal-loader reservations +0 regex workers;
all observed direct children closed, no signals. Across three versions49 direct
children and34 loader reservations; three outer supervisors and three runner
processes are separate. Loader reservations are accounting for internal loader
execution, not evidence of additional OS process births. Development/editing/data
helpers are outside the runner's child receipt; this is not a kernel-wide census.
All tool sessions returned; no background session or test server remains.

The bounded serial child launcher and fixed loader stayed unchanged in role;
conditional regex never acquired a Worker. Retained run scratch totals179302966
bytes across versions, separate from publication/data/tool metadata. All old roots
are retained, not cleaned to hide failure. Original master caps60min/128ALL/peak4,
40loader admissions/12qualifiedWorkers/256MiBcapture/1GiBwork are recorded in
preseal; successor local allowances were lowered, not reset upward.

Raw capsule: `results-v3/RAW.json.gz`,263 top-level capture records,
19668773 raw bytes/8751739 compressed, SHA256
`ef94123b74862739885da552e5d348b64c194f0a444a391394b3f55d615bd21e`.
Roundtrip hashes verified. This deliberately excludes duplicated directory trees;
full package bytes, raw blob transport, result/member manifests, process outputs
and loader traces are present. It is not an archive of every temporary directory.
No AGENTS plaintext is materialized/captured. The original source-helper ENOENT
and inline inspection syntax failure are disclosed separately, not passes.

## Remaining profile qualifications

Basic pattern/C-locale and fixed-width literal numerics are bounded subsets;
extglob, POSIX ERE/captures, advanced arithmetic, timestamps/identity/device/
descriptor predicates refuse. Private4096nodes/depth64 are explicit syntax
admission, not configurable resource limits. Existing genuine ShellLimitError
behavior is retained. GNU diagnostics, unary arity/array edge cases and all
original40 native design cases remain UNRUN; Unit2's11 OPEN rows remain open.
Review source quality and hidden safety neighbors independently before acceptance.
