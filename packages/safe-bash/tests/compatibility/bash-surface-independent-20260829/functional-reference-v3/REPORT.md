# Functional reference launcher v3 — narrow author handoff

Date: August 29, 2026. **SOURCE/DATA candidate; independent review and native GO pending.**

## Scope and retained history

Sagan review 595a9bc3938fc5ff9b048f7f30fb87ec9e4ba7ca found two remaining boundaries after v2. N08 demonstrates the old terminal deadline defect; it is not acceptance. Old v2 source a5fd225af5f9985ae805f48ab1b1790a9c3fbc7f, evidence f9fe59338cf01863735ee67bef5ae03ef993d053, all old controls/captures and reviewer records remain unchanged. Historical 12 author and 10 novel observations are not rescored as v3 acceptance. The FD-wrapper derivative's five retired Node processes/known shell roles remain separately qualified by that review, not rerun here.

## Exact repair

- storage.mjs: terminal checks the inclusive final deadline before acquisition/write/flush and after independent close, before qualified success. Expired final rejects before opening anything. The existing emergency byte reserve gives **no extra time**. Normal writes gain checks immediately before open/write/flush too. A blocking operation can overrun: subsequent writes/credit are denied; already written bytes are not rolled back. This is cooperative checking, not syscall preemption or a hard wall-clock bound.
- Terminal primary errors retain identity. Close failures are secondary when appropriate; one independent close-cleanup attempt remains bounded. Any such failure denies qualification even if the cleanup close succeeds. Late cleanup is recorded in memory as late, never compliant. No additional cleanup time or publication permission is granted.
- state.mjs/entry.mjs: observation completion passes the original capture/files/lifecycle predicates, then an inclusive deadline check before its journal write and again before increment. The journal is deliberately named OBSERVATION_READY_FOR_CREDIT, not proof of credit if the clock expires afterward. A terminal publication does not earn semantic observation credit.
- entry.mjs: removed the unbudgeted raw stderr catch fallback. Primary/secondary publication errors remain distinct in memory and the owner fails. If the final deadline has expired, no new terminal/error output is promised or authorized. Independent capture/resource cleanup is still attempted; late/unknown cleanup cannot qualify. No claim that every failure can be durably published after deadline.
- admission.mjs: exact ROOT grant startupScope is mandatory. Runtime/module loading still requires external authentication of every source before execution; inner admission is not a substitute.

## Trusted-host startup boundary (ROOT-selected)

Initial exec_command tool-shell startup **before the authenticated owned entry** is TRUSTED HOST/tool behavior, outside this functional cohort's child fresh-environment and owned raw-capture qualification. login:false does not imply all startup suppression; env-i operates later. No user startup files were inspected or changed. Their behavior is neither observed nor certified by this packet.

The fresh exact environment, owned HOME/TMPDIR, empty PATH, absent BASH_ENV/ENV/exported functions, and --noprofile/--norc apply to the Node-launched Bash children. The earlier FD derivative does not qualify initial tool startup. No Bash-child permission, host-home access, executable, network scope or containment claim is broadened. APPROVAL-REQUEST.template.json states this at the callsite and fixes all command bytes except its designated future grant-hash slot.

## New finite evidence

CONTROL-PRESEAL.json seals six identities and actual on-disk source before import. CONTROLS-RESULTS.json and DATA-CONTROLS.jsonl retain all results: **6/6 DATA identities matched**, zero new target/control children, no entry/lifecycle/product/Worker/native imports or execution. Test dependencies are the existing coordinator, Node builtins, storage.mjs and state.mjs only. Synthetic clock/IO results are not real filesystem fault, ten-minute overrun, process retirement or native semantic proof.

D01 permits finalization at the inclusive final boundary after body cutoff. D02 refuses already expired terminal and credit with zero IO. D03 expires during open: close still occurs, no write/flush. D04 preserves fsync-primary/close-secondary identities and denies credit despite successful second close. D05 detects late close after existing bytes, denies qualification/credit. D06 allows only the ready-for-credit journal attempt; if it returns late no completed count or terminal write follows. The synthetic failure observations themselves are successful author controls, not qualified native observations.

## Unchanged future functional profile

AUDIT raw bytes retain40 literal programs/four fixtures. REQUESTS retains37 literal argv/stdin/environment layout definitions; only the owned namespace changes from v2 to v3. B26/B27/B28 remain withheld. B20/B21/B39 allow only exact failed lookup names mapfile/readarray/__surface_missing_command__ in fresh empty PATH, not external execution permission. Local Bash3.2.57 is not GNU5.3. Original containment9/40 stay HOLD/UNRUN; future functional37 stays UNRUN. No product/candidate/engine build or run; no XAN, private files, network, log, crash-record or version probe.

Limits are byte-for-byte identical to v2:600000ms inclusive setup/body/publication/cleanup,60000ms setup and reserved finalization tail;3000ms case, TERM2000/KILL1000. Known managed ceiling80/peak6; planned owner1+37 Bash, zero administrative children during the actual entry. Source-derived13 internal fork reservations are separate, not a universal observed census or OS quota. Stream65536 bytes, aggregate33554432, work134217728, byte reserve65536; sampling can observe overshoot, not prevent arbitrary child writes or bound RSS. No new actual reservation/GO exists. Preparation metadata/apply_patch processes and existing coordinator are separately recorded.

## Review and activation prerequisites

Review source, six controls, expired-final path, no-credit counterexamples, startupScope refusal, and every source/template/receipt binding. Existing v2 lifecycle/FD evidence is inherited with explicit limits, not newly executed. PRESEAL plus INPUT-DELTA provide exact source and input closure. No GO.json or accepted receipt is generated. Fresh independent acceptance and ROOT grant must precede resolving/reviewing the one hash slot and requesting tool approval. No activation is authorized by this handoff.
