## Suppressed blank bodies

Normal `<`/`>` and context `!`/`+`/`-` without the usual following
space represent complete empty data lines. Bare context blank lines represent
shared empty data lines only while consuming the declared side range. Existing
count, incomplete-EOF, paired-change, and unified overlap checks remain active.

GNU Diffutils 3.12 documents `--suppress-blank-empty` for these formats in its
“Omitting trailing blanks” section. The frozen independent native evidence shows
GNU patch 2.8 rejects its own normal-format generated case; this implementation
intentionally supports the well-defined generated input rather than copying
that native failure. Context suppressed-blank input is accepted by that oracle.

Scope excludes repeated-context selector dialect choices, legacy range policy,
and asymmetric F0 placement. This is not universal GNU/BSD compatibility.
