# Empty-directory removal

`FileSystem.rmdir?(path: string, options?: FsOptions): Promise<void>` is an
optional, directory-only operation. `FsOptions` contains only `signal`; this
operation has no recursive or force mode. Existing `rm` semantics are unchanged.
Existing structural filesystem implementations remain valid without `rmdir`.

A supported call removes an empty directory entry, never its descendants or a
final symlink. Nonempty directories fail with `FsError.code === "ENOTEMPTY"`;
nondirectories (including final symlinks) fail with `ENOTDIR`; missing paths fail
with `ENOENT`. Preserve the directory and its children on these failures.
Protect virtual and mounted roots from removal. Permission, read-only, IO and
path-resolution failures retain their normal typed errors.

Emptiness must be enforced by the removal operation, not a prior `readdir`
followed by recursive deletion. A concurrent child must not be deleted because
an earlier listing was empty. Do not approximate this operation with
`rm({ recursive: true })`, a recursive remote collection DELETE, or traversal
and deletion of descendants. A backend unable to provide safe empty-directory
removal must leave the namespace unchanged and return `ENOTSUP`; absence of
the optional method is also an explicit unsupported capability at consumers.
Method presence alone does not guarantee support for every mounted path.

Forward `signal` into host work and reject a pre-aborted call before mutation.
Cancellation cannot undo a removal already performed by the host. This method
does not add a namespace transaction, descriptor-relative path identity or a
global snapshot guarantee to the existing filesystem contract.

Consumer checks may improve diagnostics, but must never replace the final safe
operation. `rm -d` uses it only for directories; ordinary file/symlink removal
and explicitly recursive `rm` continue to use `rm`. Missing capability is not
silently ignored, including with `rm -df`.
