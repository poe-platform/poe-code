# Producer-v2: full real package closure PASS, no runtime acceptance

Preseal commit: fe109f8b8b18c18188b79f2dfd64f68ca0940fdb.

## Actual archive

- Archive: package/virtual-bash-0.0.0.tgz
- SHA256: 4f90df04dba998f184473254bb450f9e085b9fc9d5994dc91a21a7ccf1d1d66e
- Compressed bytes: 908381; mode: 644
- Full regular members: 1002; summed member bytes: 5021166
- Decoded tar bytes: 5784064
- Complete member path/mode/size/SHA256 inventory: PACKAGE-MANIFEST.json
- Actual npm producer stdout and stderr: A10.stdout / A10.stderr

One npm10.9.7 pack --offline --ignore-scripts producer retired exit0. Exact sealed
environment uses TWO distinct empty regular user/global configs, separate real
paths/inodes and owned cache/HOME. No ambient npm environment was inherited.
The original22260dd7 same-config failure remains literal and unrescored.

Before the first full-buffer archive read, lstat and a bounded streaming digest
verified actual bytes/size against producer SHA1/SHA512. The archive itself and
PRE-INFLATE-RECEIPT.json were committed. Then an O_NOFOLLOW descriptor verified
regular type/size/mode; an exact-size bounded read plus EOF check filled one buffer.
All hashes were checked again, and ONLY that buffer was inflated with a64MiB
limit (compressed limit16MiB). No archive extraction occurred. Tar checksums,
regular-only safe unique paths, modes and every byte hash match the complete
compiled shipping set and npm manifest. This is real full-package inventory proof,
not an expected-count assumption or a source-only projection.

## Binding and postguards

Before pack and after package validation, all1305 retained source/compiled members,
all305 selected source inputs,48 private engine/transport emitted assets,241 tool
files and the complete npm tool tree (2027 regular
files/12 contained symlinks) reauthenticated. Node
binary size/hash/path matched. Postguards reject extra/missing candidate or npm
members as well as changed bytes. Public package exports/dependencies are unchanged
and all targets (including wildcard existence) are present; package.json itself
matches the bound source exactly. Detailed public/private bindings are in the
manifest. Zero runtime dependencies. Source remains exact e013 + engine72187 +
transport46611; no live B35, HEAD or Node309 overlay.

## Limits and what did NOT run

Fresh producer-only campaign:1 npm producer,0 compilers/type reruns,0 installs,
0 product/runtime imports,0 Workers/engine/Shell/native/network activation. All70
integration obligations remain UNRUN, and actual transport60-variant acceptance
remains separately pending. No semantic, runtime, full Bash, coherent Node or
resource/RSS guarantee follows from this package proof.

Producer coordinator completed with 114732 captured child bytes and
3332398 owned bytes at its pre-manifest storage
snapshot; elapsed from fresh startup through its result was 214842ms.
All3 producer-phase children (npm and2 scoped receipt-commit Git processes) closed
normally; preseal administrative children also have literal retirement receipts.

Known role plan is18, cap24, peak2. A13 is actually this publication Node helper
(exec replaces shell), rather than the plan wording publication patch shell; A14
is its apply_patch child. This changes no count or execution scope. A15–A18 final
publication/index outcomes are not precredited here: their literal receipt files
are retained after their own evidence commit and summarized in the response.
The fresh600s clock includes publication; old64 administration remains uncertified.
No invisible host-transitive census claim. Original raw staging and foreign index
are preserved, no cleanup or source edit occurred.

Ready for independent rebind/package SOURCE review. This closes only the producer
artifact gap; actual transport and later70×layout integration approvals remain
required. Original TS2724, earlier config failure and all prior qualifiers remain.
