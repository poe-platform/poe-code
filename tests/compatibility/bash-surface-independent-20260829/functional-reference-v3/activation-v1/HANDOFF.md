Exact command string SHA256 (without COMMAND.txt's final LF): b514681b0c165c2b029992c08b89dcf3ac793dc062f5ad4d6e7b5eb24c0bd1f6. The resolution changes only the parameters.cmd grant-hash placeholder; the explanatory requiredResolution mention remains unchanged. All other template bytes and tool parameters are identical to template 9243e5eb6c3db5fce5bee733740a2f59c0d8d447f1e3e38fe46fd476db00f6b7. The runtime receipt preserves exactly the reviewed eight-field schema; reviewCommit names Sagan's original commit, and reviewer descriptor includes the generic digest explicitly (see ROOT-AUTHORIZATION.md).

Grant absolute final expiry: **2026-08-29T09:03:39.808Z / 1787994219808**. This is a fixed review/approval scheduling boundary, not extra runtime. Entry effective deadline stays min(expiry, entry start+600000). Require a full ten-minute fresh window before starting; no silent expiry edit/clock extension if delayed.

DATA preflight authenticated24 sealed files,4 tool hashes,4 parent identities, empty capture/case directories and journal, original receipt Git object, runtime receipt/GO and exact single-slot resolution. The admission helper was invoked as DATA only; entry/Bash/approval were not invoked. One initial helper assertion incorrectly counted the explanatory placeholder as a second executable slot; its SLOT_COUNT failure and corrected property-specific check remain separately recorded, not relabeled an original pass.

Initial tool-shell startup is TRUSTED HOST outside the child fresh-environment/raw-capture qualification. Custom test Seatbelt is ABSENT. No OS containment/security/Bash5.3/product-native-fallback claim.37 functional cases remain UNRUN,3 withheld, original containment9/40/P2 HOLD unchanged. Runtime38 planned managed roles (owner1+37 Bash),80-known-managed ceiling including administration/peak6;13 source fork reservations separate. The reviewed10-minute inclusive/stream/capture/work limits are unchanged.

**Remaining conditions before any execution:** Sagan's separate DATA-only resolved-slot ACCEPT; committed exact grant and fresh preflight; then actual tool-level approval using exactly the resolved parameters (require_escalated, login:false, no prefix rule). Rejection/unsupported means STOP, not reroute. No approval request is issued by this handoff. Root coordinates the slot-review return.
